## Tool 8: Quick Reference Cards

### The 90-Day Rule
Give any new direction at least 90 days before concluding it's broken. A fair test requires:
- Clear hypothesis documented at start
- Defined success metrics and thresholds
- Sufficient resources to execute properly
- Commitment not to change the variable being tested
- Weekly reviews to track without overreacting

### Cascade Quick Reference

| If You Pivot... | These Also Change |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Customers | Problem + Solution + Technology + Growth |
| Problem | Solution + Technology + Growth |
| Solution | Technology + Growth |
| Technology | Growth (maybe) |
| Growth | Nothing |

### Evidence Levels
- **Assumed** → Haven't tested (Low)
- **Anecdotal** → Few customers (Low-Medium)
- **Pattern** → Many customers (Medium)
- **Quantified** → Data at scale (Medium-High)
- **Validated** → Paid proving it (High)

### Pivot Cost Estimates

| Type | Time | Capital | Blast Radius |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| Growth | Days-weeks | $5K-50K | 0 layers |
| Technology | Weeks-months | 1-6 months burn | 1 layer |
| Solution | Months | 3-12 months burn | 2 layers |
| Problem | Months-quarters | 6-18 months burn | 3 layers |
| Customer | Quarters-years | $2M+ | 4 layers |

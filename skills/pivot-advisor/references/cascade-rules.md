# The Cascade Principle

## The Three Cascade Rules

1. **Changes cascade upward.** When a layer changes, everything above must be reconsidered.
2. **Changes don't cascade downward.** When a layer changes, nothing below is affected.
3. **The lower the layer, the wider the cascade.** Customer pivots affect 4 layers. Growth pivots affect 0.

## Blast Radius by Pivot Type

### Customer Pivot (Layer 1) — Blast Radius: 4 layers

When you change who you're building for:
- **Problem changes:** Different customers have different problems
- **Solution changes:** Different approach needed for different segment
- **Technology changes:** Different solutions may require different tech
- **Growth changes:** Different customers reached through different channels

### Problem Pivot (Layer 2) — Blast Radius: 3 layers

When you change the pain point for the same customers:
- **Solution changes:** New problems require new solutions
- **Technology changes:** New solutions may require new tech
- **Growth changes:** New value propositions need new positioning
- **Customers remain:** Still serving the same people

### Solution Pivot (Layer 3) — Blast Radius: 2 layers

When you change how you solve the same problem:
- **Technology changes:** New solutions need new implementations
- **Growth changes:** New products need new go-to-market
- **Problem remains:** Still solving the same pain
- **Customers remain:** Still serving the same people

### Technology Pivot (Layer 4) — Blast Radius: 1 layer

When you change how you build the solution:
- **Growth may change:** New capabilities may enable new channels
- **Solution remains:** Still delivering the same value
- **Problem remains:** Still solving the same pain
- **Customers remain:** Still serving the same people

### Growth Pivot (Layer 5) — Blast Radius: 0 layers

When you change how you acquire users:
- **Nothing below changes.** Product, technology, solution, problem, and customers remain exactly the same.

## Pivot Cost Analysis

### Time Cost

| Pivot Type | Typical Time to Execute |
|------------|------------------------|
| Growth | Days to weeks |
| Technology | Weeks to months |
| Solution | Months |
| Problem | Months to quarters |
| Customer | Quarters to years |

### Capital Cost

- **Growth pivots:** $5K-50K for new channel experiments
- **Technology pivots:** 1-6 months of engineering burn
- **Solution pivots:** 3-12 months of product development burn
- **Problem/Customer pivots:** 6-18+ months of burn for discovery, validation, and rebuild

### Team Capability Cost

- Growth pivot from content to paid → needs performance marketing expertise
- Technology pivot from monolith to microservices → needs distributed systems experience
- Customer pivot from SMB to enterprise → needs enterprise sales capabilities

### Opportunity Cost

While pivoting: competitors advance, existing customers may churn, team momentum disrupted.

## The Inverse Relationship

**Lower pivots = higher cost but higher potential impact.**
**Upper pivots = lower cost but lower potential impact.**

Strategic implication: **Start experiments at the top of the pyramid.**

Before pivoting customers → exhaust growth experiments.
Before pivoting problem → truly test different solutions.
Before pivoting solution → optimize technology.

Only pivot lower layers when upper layers are solid but the lower layer is clearly broken.

## Cascade Analysis for Decision Making

Before committing to any pivot, answer three questions:

### 1. What specifically am I changing?

Be precise:
- Bad: "We're pivoting to enterprise"
- Good: "We're changing target customer from individual developers to engineering teams at 100+ employee companies"

### 2. What else must change as a result?

Trace the cascade. If changing the problem, what happens to solution, technology, and growth? Write it out explicitly.

### 3. Is the potential impact worth the cascade cost?

A customer pivot that 10x's your market but requires 18 months and $2M might be worth it. One that 2x's your market for the same cost probably isn't.

## Cascade Checklists

### For Customer Pivots:
- [ ] Fully validated that current segment can't support a viable business?
- [ ] Done extensive discovery with new customer segment?
- [ ] Team capabilities to serve this new segment?
- [ ] Runway for a 12-18 month pivot?
- [ ] Modeled new problem, solution, technology, and growth layers?

### For Problem Pivots:
- [ ] Validated current customers want to pay for the new problem?
- [ ] New problem more urgent than current problem?
- [ ] Domain expertise for new problem space?
- [ ] Modeled new solution, technology, and growth layers?

### For Solution Pivots:
- [ ] New solution addresses the same validated problem?
- [ ] 10x better than alternatives?
- [ ] Capabilities to build it?
- [ ] Modeled new technology and growth layers?

### For Technology Pivots:
- [ ] New technology enables solution more effectively?
- [ ] Technical skills to execute?
- [ ] Migration path manageable?
- [ ] What growth opportunities does this unlock?

### For Growth Pivots:
- [ ] Truly exhausted current channels?
- [ ] New channel matches customer behavior?
- [ ] Skills to execute in new channel?
- [ ] Can test with limited resources before committing?

## Case Study: Restaurant Tech Cascade

A restaurant tech startup pivoted from "menus are expensive to print" (Problem) to "delivery apps take 30% commission" (Problem):

| Layer | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Customers | Independent restaurants | Independent restaurants (unchanged) |
| Problem | Menu printing costs | 30% delivery commission |
| Solution | QR code digital menus | Online ordering system |
| Technology | Simple CMS + QR | Order management + payments + kitchen display |
| Growth | "Save money on menus" | "Keep 100% of your delivery revenue" |

The new problem was "hair on fire" — every order saved real money. Companies like ChowNow (20K+ restaurants) and Toast ($20B+ IPO) proved the model.

**Lesson:** Many founders thought they had a growth problem. The real problem was one layer lower — solving a "nice to have" instead of a "must have."

# Pivot Playbooks by Layer

## Customer Pivot Playbook

The most consequential pivot. You're changing who you build for — essentially starting a new company.

### When to Consider

1. Current customers can't pay enough (unit economics don't work)
2. Current customers don't have urgent problems (endless sales cycles)
3. Found accidental traction elsewhere (unexpected segment getting more value)
4. Market is contracting (target customers going away)

### Step 1: Identify New Customer

Get specific:
- **Demographics:** Who are they specifically?
- **Situation:** What circumstances define them?
- **Urgency:** Why do they need something now?
- **Budget:** Can they pay what you need?

**The Specificity Test:**
- Bad: "We're pivoting to enterprise customers"
- Good: "VP-level marketing leaders at B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees spending $50K+ annually on multiple point solutions"

### Step 2: Validate the New Customer Exists

Before committing, verify:
- Can you find 20 of these customers in one week?
- Will 5 of them talk to you for 30 minutes?
- Do at least 3 have the exact problem you think?
- Will at least 1 pay for a solution?

If you can't pass this test, you're pivoting to a fantasy.

### Step 3: Map the Cascade

Customer pivots cascade through every layer. Document what changes for Problem, Solution, Technology, and Growth.

### Step 4: Plan for Identity Shift

Prepare for:
- Saying goodbye to early adopters
- Learning an entirely new domain
- Building new relationships from scratch
- Potentially changing company name and brand

## Problem Pivot Playbook

Same customers, different pain point. More contained than customer pivots — may be able to bring existing customers along.

### When to Consider

1. Problem isn't painful enough (customers acknowledge but won't pay)
2. Problem is already solved (incumbents are good enough)
3. Discovered a bigger problem (customers keep asking for something adjacent)
4. Problem is going away (market changes eliminating the pain)

### Step 1: Discover the Real Problem

**Listen for Workarounds:**
- What manual processes are customers using?
- What spreadsheets have they built?
- What do they complain about but accept as "just how it is"?

**Watch Behavior:**
- What features do they actually use?
- Where do they spend time in your product?
- What do they do before and after using your product?

**Ask Different Questions:**
- "What's the hardest part of your day?"
- "If you had a magic wand, what would you fix?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this area?"

### Step 2: Validate Problem Severity

**The Willingness Tests:**
1. **Will they talk about it?** (Low bar) — Sharing details and frustrations vs. "it's fine"
2. **Will they show you?** (Medium bar) — Walking through current process vs. "don't have time"
3. **Will they pay for it?** (High bar) — Budget commitment or paid pilot vs. "not a priority"

### Step 3: Assess the Cascade

Problem pivots cascade to Solution, Technology, and Growth. Customers stay constant.

### Step 4: Transition Existing Customers

Unlike customer pivots, you may bring them along:
- Communicate the shift: "We're expanding to help you with X"
- Grandfather existing features
- Migrate gradually: add new before deprecating old

## Solution Pivot Playbook

Same customers, same problem, different approach to solving it.

### When to Consider

1. Solution doesn't actually solve the problem (problem persists despite usage)
2. Solution is too complex (time-to-value too long)
3. Solution doesn't fit the workflow (too much change required)
4. Fundamentally better approach exists (new technology enables it)
5. Economics don't work (costs more to deliver than customers pay)

### Step 1: Clarify What Stays Constant

Document explicitly:
- Customers: [Who are they?]
- Problem: [What pain are we solving?]
- Success metric: [How will we know if we've solved it?]

If unclear on these, may need a foundational pivot instead.

### Step 2: Identify Why Current Solution Fails

| Failure Type | Example | Solution Direction |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Effectiveness | "Doesn't actually fix the problem" | Different approach |
| Usability | "Too hard to use" | Simpler interface |
| Workflow fit | "Doesn't work with our tools" | Better integration |
| Time-to-value | "Takes too long to see results" | Faster path |
| Cost | "Too expensive to deliver" | More efficient approach |

### Step 3: Generate Alternatives and Apply 10x Test

For each alternative: "Is this at least 10x better on some dimension that matters?"
If not, don't pivot — you're trading one mediocre solution for another.

### Step 4: Validate Before Building

- **Concierge MVP:** Manually deliver the new solution to a few customers
- **Wizard of Oz:** Look automated but run manually behind the scenes
- **Prototype test:** Build minimum to test core hypothesis

### Step 5: Plan the Cascade

Solution pivots cascade to Technology and sometimes Growth.

## Technology Pivot Playbook

Same customer, problem, and solution — different implementation.

### When to Consider

1. Technology can't scale (breaks at 10K users)
2. Technology is too expensive (unsustainable infrastructure costs)
3. Better technology has emerged (new platform/capability)
4. Technology creates wrong UX (performance/reliability issues)
5. Platform shifts occurring (mobile, cloud, AI-native)

### Step 1: Distinguish Pivot from Engineering Debt

| Problem | Pivot Needed? | Better Approach |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Code is messy | No | Refactoring |
| Using wrong database | Maybe | Migration |
| Wrong programming language | Rarely | Live with it or gradual rewrite |
| Wrong platform entirely | Yes | Technology Pivot |
| Missing core capability | Yes | Technology Pivot |

### Step 2: Assess True Cost

- Development costs (engineering time, new tools, learning curve)
- Opportunity costs (features not built, customers not acquired)
- Risk costs (migration failures, customer disruption, team attrition)

### Step 3: Choose Migration Path

**Big Bang:** Rebuild everything at once. High risk, potentially faster. Works for small codebases.
**Strangler Fig:** Build new around old, gradually migrate. Lower risk, longer timeline.
**Parallel Systems:** Run both simultaneously, migrate incrementally. Highest cost, lowest risk.

### Step 4: Protect Customer Experience

- Maintain feature parity — don't regress
- Keep performance stable or improve
- Communicate if necessary
- Preserve data — migration must be flawless

## Growth Pivot Playbook

Everything stays the same except how you acquire and retain customers.

### When to Consider

1. CAC is unsustainable (exceeds LTV)
2. Growth has stalled (channels saturated)
3. Competition changed the landscape (outbid on channels)
4. Discovered more efficient channel
5. Growth approach doesn't match customers (B2C tactics for B2B)

### Step 1: Diagnose Current State

Document channel performance:
- Paid acquisition: CAC, LTV, ratio
- Organic/SEO: Volume, conversion rate
- Referral: % of new users, k-factor
- Sales: Deal size, cycle length, win rate

### Step 2: Identify Alternative Growth Engines

**Paid Growth Engine:** Spend money to acquire. Works when LTV > CAC with acceptable payback.
**Viral Growth Engine:** Customers bring customers. Works when product has inherent shareability.
**Sticky Growth Engine:** High retention compounds growth. Works when product becomes essential.

| Business Type | Best Primary Engine | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| High LTV B2B | Paid/Sales | Can justify high CAC |
| Consumer app | Viral | Users easily invite others |
| SaaS tool | Sticky | Workflow integration creates retention |
| Marketplace | Viral + Network effects | Both sides need to grow |
| Enterprise | Sales | Complex buying process |

### Step 3: Design and Test

1. Define hypothesis: "We believe [channel] will acquire at [CAC] with [quality]"
2. Set test parameters: budget, timeline, success criteria
3. Run contained test with limited exposure
4. Measure rigorously
5. Decide: double down, adjust, or try something else

### Step 4: Growth Pivot Decision Tree

1. **Retention Check:** Day 30 retention > 20%? If NO → fix product first
2. **Economics Check:** CAC/LTV ratio > 3:1? If YES → current growth may be fine, optimize
3. **Ceiling Check:** Diminishing returns on current channels? If NO → scale current approach
4. **Alternative Check:** Specific alternative hypothesis? If NO → research first
5. **Resource Check:** Can test without disrupting current growth? If NO → sequence carefully. If YES → execute.

## Common Execution Tactics (All Pivot Types)

### The Two-Week Sprint (Customer/Problem Pivots)
- Week 1: Define hypothesis, talk to 10 potential customers, synthesize
- Week 2: Build prototype/mockup, get feedback from 5, decide go/no-go

### The Fake Door Test
1. Landing page describing new focus
2. Drive targeted traffic
3. Measure interest (signups, inquiries, willingness to pay)
4. Validate or invalidate

### The Beachhead Approach
1. Identify smallest viable segment
2. Become dominant with that segment
3. Use that base to expand

### The 80/20 Transition (Growth Pivots)
1. Keep 80% of resources on current approach
2. Dedicate 20% to testing new approach
3. Shift ratio as new approach proves out
